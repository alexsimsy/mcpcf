1. **Get your MCP Token:**
   - Log in to the [SIMSY App](https://simsy.app) and copy your MCP Token from your account page.

   - If your tool supports direct HTTP/SSE MCP servers, use:
     - URL: `https://mcp.s-imsy.com/mcp`
     - Bearer token: your MCP Token
   - If your tool only supports local/stdio MCP servers (VS Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.), use the [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) proxy as described in the main README.

## üìù Notes

- **SIM Name Selection:**
  - Most clients will show a dropdown of available SIM names. If not, type the name exactly as shown in the `getSims` output.
  - If you enter an invalid name, the error message will list all available SIM names.

- **Authentication:**
  - Always use your MCP Token as a Bearer token. Never share your token.

- **Troubleshooting:**
  - If you have connection or authentication issues, double-check your token and client configuration.
  - For stdio-only clients, make sure you are using `mcp-remote` as described in the main README.
